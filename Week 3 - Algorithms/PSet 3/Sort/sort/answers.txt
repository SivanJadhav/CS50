sort1 uses: Bubble

How do you know?: Performs slow in reversed lists, and as it requires a lot of swaps, it suits bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge

How do you know?: Because it took the almost the same amount of time regardless of if the list was sorted or not, reversed or not. Merge sort does that because no matter the order, it performs all the steps.

sort3 uses: Selection

How do you know?: Because it performs well in reversed and large quantities.
