## **Overview:**
**WorKing Out 50** is developed as the final project for **CS50x**. This project addresses the modern sedentary lifestyle by encouraging active living through structured workouts and healthy diet plans. It integrates lessons from notable books like _Ikigai_ and _Atomic Habits_, providing a holistic approach to maintaining physical and mental health.

## **Key Features:**

### **Science-Backed Workouts:**
All workout routines and diet plans are researched and backed by scientific sources. The exercises, sets, reps, and diets are designed to maximize health benefits. Users can trust that the guidance provided is grounded in the latest fitness and nutritional science, ensuring effective and safe practices.

### **Lessons From Books:**
#### **Ikigai:**
Emphasizes the importance of staying active and engaged in activities you love, contributing to both mental and physical well-being. _Ikigai_ teaches that a fulfilling life involves a balance of work and play, encouraging users to find joy in their daily routines.

#### **Atomic Habits:**
Highlights four key elements to forming and sustaining habits:
- **Obviousness:** Ensure cues in your environment trigger the habit. For example, placing your workout gear where you can see it.
- **Attractiveness:** Make the habit attractive to create a craving. This could involve rewarding yourself with a healthy snack after a workout.
- **Ease:** Start small and make the habit easy to adopt. Consistency is key, so even short, daily workouts can be very effective.
- **Satisfaction:** Reward yourself immediately to reinforce the habit. Positive reinforcement makes it more likely that you will repeat the behavior.

    - **Cue:** Identify and create triggers in your environment. These could be visual cues, like seeing your yoga mat laid out.
    - **Craving:** Make the habit attractive through temptation bundling or joining like-minded communities. Finding a workout buddy or joining a fitness class can make exercise more enjoyable.
    - **Response:** Take small, steady steps towards your goal. Gradual progress helps maintain motivation and reduces the risk of burnout.
    - **Reward:** Immediate rewards make the habit satisfying and repeatable. Celebrating small victories keeps you motivated.

### **Technologies Used:**
- **Python:** Utilized for backend development with Flask to handle routing and requests. Python‚Äôs simplicity and power make it ideal for web development and managing data.
- **HTML/CSS:** Used for frontend design, creating the user interface, and styling components. These technologies ensure the application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **SQL:** Manages databases for storing user data and other relevant information. A robust database is crucial for maintaining user information securely and efficiently.
- **APIs:** Employed to fetch meals and exercise data. APIs allow for dynamic and updated content, enhancing the user experience with relevant data.

## **Project Impact:**
